# Setup (Build)

In order to start using this engine you need [CMake](https://cmake.org/download/) and [Go](https://go.dev/dl/) installed.

First, clone this repository:

```
git clone https://github.com/Flone-dnb/nameless-engine
cd nameless-engine
git submodule update --init
```

If you've never used CMake before:

When installed, clone/download this repository and create a `build` directory next to this file, open created `build` directory and type `cmd` in Explorer's address bar. This will open up a console in which you need to type this:

```
cmake -DCMAKE_BUILD_TYPE=Debug .. // for debug mode
cmake .. // for release mode
```

This will generate engine editor project files that you will use for development.

# Update

To update this repository:

```
git pull
git submodule update
```

# Documentation

This documentation requires `doxygen` to be installed.

The documentation can be generated by executing the `doxygen` command while being in the `docs` folder. If doxygen is installed, this will be done automatically on each build.

The generated documentation will be located at `docs/gen/html`, open the `index.html` file from this folder to see the documentation.
